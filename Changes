Revision history for Perl extension Win32::MachineInfo.

** 0.05 2003-08-31

Added support for detecting Itanium family processors.

Video and display settings now returned correctly for Windows XP systems.

Thanks to Adam McGrath for these changes.

Fixed the example list of hash keys in the documentation.
$info was incorrectly used as a reference to a hash ($info->{'key'}).

** 0.04 2003-01-20

ComputerName now read correctly from the registry.

reformat_date now handles empty or undefined values.

** 0.03 2003-01-19

Tidied up all the registry value references to cope with undefined
values.

** 0.02 2003-01-16

Some systems did not have the VideoBiosVersion key, and the code that
referred to it assumed it did and failed because it was attempting
to do @{undef}, so the code was modified to check that the key
existed before dereferencing it. Similarly for the SystemBiosVersion
registry key.

The HardwareInformation.AdapterString and the Hotfix registry keys
did not exist on some systems, and both values required manipulation
before being placed into the %info hash, so the code was bracketed
in if statements to avoid error messages.

** 0.01 2003-01-15

Initial release.
